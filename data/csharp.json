    {
      "question": "What is C#?",
      "answer": "C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is used to build many types of applications—desktop, web, mobile, cloud, games—and runs on the `.NET` platform."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is .NET?",
      "answer": ".NET is the ecosystem that supports C# programs. It includes:\n\n- The **runtime** that executes your code\n- The **Base Class Library (BCL)** that provides ready-made functionality\n- **SDK tools** that help you build applications\n- Additional components for creating **web, mobile, and desktop apps**\n\nIt is also shared by multiple programming languages, not just C#."
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. C# is a special-purpose language optimized for making web applications.",
      "answer": "**False.** C# is a general-purpose programming language designed to build many types of applications—not just web apps."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two main components of a C# project, and what file extensions does each one use?",
      "answer": "- **Solution file (`.sln`)**: organizes one or more projects\n- **Project file (`.csproj`)**: defines the project and its settings"
    },
    {
      "question": "When creating a new C# project, in what situation should you check 'Place solution and project in the same directory,' and why?",
      "answer": "Check this option if you want a **simpler folder structure** where the solution file and project files are together. Otherwise, the solution can be separate and manage multiple projects."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do we need a compiler when writing C# programs, and what types of files does the compiler produce for the computer to run?",
      "answer": "The **compiler** converts human-readable C# code into **Intermediate Language (IL)**, which the .NET runtime can execute. The compiler produces `.exe` or `.dll` files."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Intermediate Language (IL), and why does C# compile into IL instead of compiling directly to machine code?",
      "answer": "IL is a CPU-independent low-level language used by .NET. C# compiles to IL so the same code can run on different platforms. The **JIT compiler** converts IL to actual machine code at runtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the .NET compilation process, what are the two main steps that occur between writing C# code and running the program?",
      "answer": "1. **C# compiler (`csc`)** converts code into IL in a `.dll` or `.exe`\n2. **JIT compiler** converts IL into machine code at runtime"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler play when running a .NET application?",
      "answer": "The JIT compiler takes IL and translates it into the **machine code** specific to the computer’s CPU **when the program runs**."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the two-step compilation process (C# → IL → machine code) help make .NET cross-platform?",
      "answer": "Because IL is **platform-neutral**, any system with a .NET runtime can JIT-compile the same IL into machine code for its own CPU and OS."
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. The final machine code that actually runs on your computer is generated during execution, not during the initial C# compilation step.",
      "answer": "**True.** The C# compiler produces IL; the machine code is produced later by the JIT compiler at runtime."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, and how does it differ from JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation?",
      "answer": "AOT compilation converts **source code or IL** into native machine code **before execution**. JIT compilation converts IL to machine code **at runtime**. AOT improves startup performance but may produce larger binaries and reduce flexibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Base Class Library (BCL) in C#, and what is its purpose?",
      "answer": "The BCL is a large collection of prewritten code providing **fundamental building blocks** for programs. It includes **namespaces, classes, methods, and properties** to avoid rewriting common functionality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the Main method in a C# program, and how does it relate to the Program class?",
      "answer": "The `Main` method is the **entry point** of a C# program—the first code executed. It resides in the `Program` class, and all other methods run when called from `Main`."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a statement in C#, and what role does it play in a program?",
      "answer": "A **statement** is a single instruction executed by the computer. Most statements end with a semicolon (`;`).\n\nExample:\n```\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n```"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a variable in programming, and what are the steps needed to use one?",
      "answer": "**Variable:** a container for data whose value can change.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Declaration:** give it a name and type\n2. **Assignment:** store a value\n3. **Usage:** use it in expressions or operations"
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. In C#, the compiler ignores extra spaces, tabs, and blank lines in the code, so whitespace has no effect on how the program runs.",
      "answer": "**True.**"
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. In the code:\n```\nint x=5;\nint      x   =   5;\n```\nproduce the same result because C# ignores extra whitespace.",
      "answer": "**True.** C# treats spaces, tabs, and blank lines as whitespace as long as tokens are properly separated."
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. In the code:\n```\nint number = 5;\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Number: \" + number);\n```\nthe string concatenation is a statement on its own.",
      "answer": "**False.** The statement is `Console.WriteLine(\"Number: \" + number);`. The expression is only part of the statement."
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. Will the following line:\n```\nConsole.WriteLine(x + y);\n```\nrun correctly if placed outside of the `Main` method, assuming `x` and `y` are declared variables?",
      "answer": "**False.** Only code inside `Main` (or methods called by `Main`) executes. Moving it outside causes a compile-time error."
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. The semicolon at the end of a statement is optional if the statement is the last line in Main.",
      "answer": "**False.** Every statement must end with a semicolon."
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. The following code:\n```\nnumber = number + 10;\n```\n does not declare a new variable; it updates the existing one.",
      "answer": "**True.** The first line declares the variable; the second line reassigns it."
    },
    {
      "question": "True/False. Even with unusual spacing and line breaks, the code will compile and run correctly.",
      "answer": "**True.** C# ignores extra or missing whitespace as long as tokens are properly separated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the following code compile?\n```\nvar x;\n```",
      "answer": "**No.** `var` must be initialized to infer the type."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the following code what is the inferred type of `input`?\n```\nvar input = Console.ReadLine();\n```\n",
      "answer": "The inferred type is **`string`**."
