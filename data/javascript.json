      "answer": "A built-in browser feature that lets you store small amounts of data directly in the user's browser. The data persists even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.\n\n**Details:**\n- Part of the **Web Storage API**\n- Stores **key–value pairs** (both are strings)\n- Data does not expire until manually removed\n- **Domain-specific** (other websites cannot access it)"

      "answer": "**Common uses:**\n- Dark/light theme preference\n- Keeping a user logged in (temporary tokens)\n- Saving quiz progress, settings, filters\n- Storing small UI preferences\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Capacity ~5MB (varies by browser)\n- Only stores **strings** (objects/arrays must be converted to JSON)\n- Not for sensitive data (no encryption)\n- **Synchronous** (can block the main thread if used heavily)"
